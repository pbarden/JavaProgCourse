/**
 * PLEASE NOTE: I had to make a lot of changes and completely re-organize this code
 * since the assignment was unclear and the code which was provided did NOT make
 * any sense to me. For example, we read and write to different files if we use the
 * code provided; I think it would make more sense to work with the same file.
 * That said, I left this piece the same but the code below should meet the requirements:
 * -Reads file input.txt
 * -Writes file data.txt
 * -Accepts user input
 * -Uses console output
